Warning: This plugin is deprecated. Please use [[%SYSTEMWEB%.VarIF][%IF]] instead. The only remaining
feature not covered boy foswiki's core means is the sectional conditionals %IFDEFINEDTHEN, %ELSIFDEFINED, %ELSEDEFINED, %FIDEFINED.

This plugin adds a couple of tags that allow to render content conditionally.
There are two different ways to do that: either by using the inline 
=%<nop>IFDEFINED{"string" then="..." else="..."}%= tag that returns the 
=then= or =else= argument depending on the =string= being defined, that is non-empty.
There are no other ways to decide the condition but rendering the =test= string 
being a <nop>TopicMarkup expression, for example by embedding a =%<nop>CALC{}%= expression. This simplifies
this plugin alot and allows a rather flexible way to generate the condition.

The other way is to use blocks of content surrounded by expressions like this:
<verbatim>
%IFDEFINEDTHEN{"test"}%
...
%ELSIFDEFINED{"test"}%
...
%ELSEDEFINED%
...
%FIDEFINED%
</verbatim>
This way the conditioned content is not limited to fit into a the argument
position of a =%<nop>IFDEFINED{...}%= expression.  Blocks can be nested and are
evaluated starting from the outside, contrary to standard <nop>TopicMarkup being
evaluated left-to-right-inside-out.

An %IF conditional is part of Foswiki as well. See Foswiki:System.IfStatements. The 
main differences between IF and IFDEFINED are
   1 IF comes with a fullfledged boolean expression parser whereas IFDEFINED only checks
     if a test expression expands to a non-empty string.
   1 This plugin comes with separate conditionals IFEXISTS and IFACCESS to implement
     some of the most commonly used tests in <nop>WikiApplications
   1 IFDEFINED's sister IFDEFINEDTHEN also provides a section-oriented conditional
   1 IFDEFINED comes with a "glue" feature to remov whitesapce before and after the
     conditional statement (can be switched off optionally)

---++ Syntax Rules
---+++ IFDEFINED
*Syntax*: 
<verbatim>
%IFDEFINED{"test" 
  [action="view,edit,preview,..."]? 
  [as="..."]
  then="..." 
  else="..." 
  glue="on,off"}%
</verbatim>

returns the "then or "else" content depending on the "test"
expression expanding to the emtpy string or matching the string given in "as".
Optionally the current topic action is checked to match the one given in "action".  
Normally, all surrounding whitespaces are removed, that is the resulting content
is glued together in a way. You may switch that off by setting "glue" to "off"
thus preventing all whitespace as it is.

The "then" and "else" strings may contain the following pseudo-variables:
   * =$n=: substituted with a newline character (\n)
   * =$percnt=: substituted with a percent character (%)
   * =$dollar=: substituted with a dollar character ($)
   * =$test= or =$variable=: substituted with the "test" string
   * =$value=: substituted with the "as" string


---+++ IFDEFINEDTHEN, ELSIFDEFINED, ELSEDEFINED, FIDEFINED
*Syntax*:
<verbatim>
%IFDEFINEDTHEN{"test" [action="view,edit,preview,..."]?}% 
  <then content> 
[%ELSIFDEFINED{...}% 
  <elsif content>]* 
[%ELSEDEFINED%
  <else content>]?
%FIDEFINED%
</verbatim>

This is the multi-line version of [[#IFSDEFINED][IFSDEFINED]].
IFDEFINEDTHEN expressions can be nested safely.  Within a single IFDEFINEDTHEN
the ELSIFDEFINED parts can be repeated arbitrarily.  Before rendering the
=&lt;then|elsif|else condition>= any =$nop= string will be removed first.
Thereby nested <nop>TopicMarkup expressions can be prevented from being expanded in
advance.

---+++ IFACCESS 

*Syntax*:
<verbatim>
%IFACCESS%

%IFACCESS{"<webtopic>" 
  [type="view|change"] 
  [user="<WikiName>"] 
  [then="<then-clause>"] 
  [else="<else-clause>"] 
  [glue="on|off"]}%
</verbatim>

This checks the access permissions a user has on a given topic and then renders
the =&lt;then-clause>= if access is granted and =lt;else-clause>= otherwise.
By default, the current user's view access will be checked on the current topic (=%<nop>IFACCESS%=).
The other parameters are:

   * =&lt;webtopic>=: the name of the topic to be checked, defaults to current
   * =user="&lt;WikiName>"=: the name of the user to be checked, defaults to the current user
   * =type="view|change"=: the type of access to be checked, either view access or change/edit access, defaults to "view"
   * =then="&lt;then-clause>"=: the string to be returned on granted access, defaults to "1"
   * =else="&lt;else-clause>"=: the string to be returned if no access is granted, defaults to "0"
   * =glue="on|off"=: apply glue around the IFACCESS tag or not, defaults to "on"

---+++ IFEXISTS
*Syntax*:
<verbatim>
%IFEXISTS{"<webtopic>"
  [then="<then-clause>"] 
  [else="<else-clause>"] 
  [glue="on|off"]}%
</verbatim>

This tag checks if =webtopic= exists and expands =then-clause= or =else-clause= as needed.
A similar functionality is available using 
=%<nop>CALC{"$IF($EXIST(&lt;webtopic>,&lt;then-clause>),&lt;else-clause>)"}%=
of the SpreadSheetPlugin.
This is still preferable if you need more computation based on CALC in the 
then/else branches. The IFEXISTS version however is more lightweigted, comes with a much simpler syntax 
and allows more complex <nop>TopicMarkup in the then/else branches.

---++ Demo
   * Set FOO = foo
   * FOO is %IFDEFINED{"%FOO%" then=" " else="not" glue="off"}% defined.
   * FOO is %IFDEFINED{"%FOO%" as="bar" then=" " else="not" glue="off"}% defined as "bar".
   * BAR is %IFDEFINED{"%BAR%" then=" " else="not" glue="off"}% defined.
   * %WIKIUSERNAME% has %IFACCESS{type="change" then=" " else=" no "}% write access to %TOPIC%
   * %USERSWEB%.WikiGuest has %IFACCESS{user="WikiGuest" type="change" then=" " else=" no "}% write access to %TOPIC%
